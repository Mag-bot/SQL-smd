### SQL-smd Project
Sakila Movie Database Usdacity Project 1

### Date Created
This was my first project for Programming for Data Science with Python.  I submitted this for review to Udacity reviewers on March 6, 2020.  

### Description
The Sakila Movie Database project was for me to showcase my understanding of coding with SQL through investigating relational databases.  I exhibited the skills necessary to query the movie rental database to make business decisions.  I asked questions that I thought were relevant to make sound business decisions.   

### Reflection
I really liked this project of them all!  I practiced the SQL skills from the lessons multiple times to understand each pull and query.  I enjoyed greatly the opportunity to turn query data into a visualization.  I played around with consistent themes and colors in my presentation and visualization for the purpose of promoting my skills and knowledge.  I have so much to learn, but I think I made a strong first impression with my knack for this field of study.
